Last updated: 28/05/2024

This application ("app") is developed and maintained by an independent developer ("I", "me"). This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information I receive from users of the app.

I use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the app. By using the app, you agree to the collection and use of information (name) in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection And Use

While using this app, I may ask you to provide me with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to personalize your experience.

## Log Data

This app does not collect any log data such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.

## Adkars

The app provides Adkars which Muslims perform every morning and evening. The app does not collect or store any information related to your religious practices.

## Streaks

The app now includes a feature ("Streaks") that allows users to mark the Adkars as read or not read. This data is stored locally on your device and is used to track your progress and provide a personalized experience. This data is not collected, stored, or shared by me. Your use of the Streaks feature is entirely voluntary.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 28/05/2024 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

I reserve the right to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the app after I post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
