# Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 4, 2025

This application ("app") is developed and maintained by an independent developer ("I", "me"). This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information I receive from users of the app.

I use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the app. By using the app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection And Use

To provide you with a personalized experience and enable cloud syncing of your data, the app collects and stores the following information:

- **Email Address:** Used for account creation and authentication
- **Password:** Securely hashed and stored for account security
- **Name:** Optional, used to personalize your experience
- **Preferences:** Your app settings, notification times, and theme preferences
- **Adkar Streaks:** Your progress tracking data for morning and evening adkar

All data is stored securely and is only accessible by you. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties.

## Authentication and Data Storage

The app uses **Supabase** (an open-source Firebase alternative) for authentication and database services. Supabase is a trusted third-party service provider that helps us securely store your data in the cloud.

Your data is stored in Supabase's secure cloud infrastructure with industry-standard encryption. Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms and are never stored in plain text.

For more information about Supabase's security practices, please visit [Supabase Security](https://supabase.com/security).

## Log Data

This app does not collect any log data such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.

## Adkars and Religious Content

The app provides authentic Islamic supplications (Adkars) from Hisnul Muslim for morning and evening remembrance. The Adkar content itself is stored locally on your device and is not tracked or monitored.

## Streak Tracking

The app includes an optional "Streaks" feature that allows you to mark your daily Adkars as completed. This data is stored in your personal account and is used solely to:

- Track your progress over time
- Display your streak count
- Provide motivation to maintain consistency

Your streak data is private and is never shared with anyone. We do not analyze, sell, or use this data for any purpose other than displaying it to you.

## Notifications

If you enable notifications, the app will send you local reminders at your chosen times for morning and evening Adkar. Notification preferences are stored in your account settings and can be modified or disabled at any time.

## Data Deletion

You have the right to request deletion of your personal data at any time. To delete your account and all associated data, please use the account deletion feature in the app settings or visit our [account deletion page](https://adkarchamp.com/delete-account).

## Data Security

We take the security of your data seriously and implement industry-standard security measures:

- All data transmissions are encrypted using HTTPS/SSL
- Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms
- Database access is protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Regular security updates and monitoring

However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Access your personal data
- Update or correct your information
- Delete your account and all associated data
- Export your data (upon request)
- Opt out of notifications

## Children's Privacy

This app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us to have it removed.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of October 4, 2025 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

I reserve the right to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the app after I post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
